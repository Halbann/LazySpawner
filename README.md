KSP mod that enables you to spawn large numbers of vessels in orbit from Flight or the Tracking Station via an easy to use GUI.

Press Alt+F to open the GUI.
Paste the path to the craft you wish to spawn (use shift-right-click "Copy as Path" in Windows).

Range == 0 will result in a random 70km orbit
Range > 0 will spawn it randomly in a bubble of radius range (metres) around the active vessel.

Currently doesn't support crew, or do any error checking for invalid parts. Therefore consider it unsafe to use in any genuine save.
